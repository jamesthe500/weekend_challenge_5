  "description": "Hello everyone! Welcome to this 'challenge'. In this one, you will not be writing any code (unless you want to), you will actually be learning from a build  that already exists. You will be going through the code and the goal of this challenge, is to learn from the build. Specifically, what I would like, is for you all to write down 'learnings' in bullet point format, of what you find in this build that taught you something you did not no before. The objective is to tinker, understand, turn things on and off, and whatever else you need to do to understand what the build is doing. Once again, the product of this challenge should be a list of learned things.",
